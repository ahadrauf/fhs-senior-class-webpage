# fhs-senior-class-webpage
This project contains the project files for Foothill High School's 2015-16 senior class webpage. HTML and CSS form the basic structure of the webpage (with support from Bootstrap v3.3.5).

JavaScript was used to automate website updates and display upcoming events on the homepage. The relevant files are in the folder `\js`.

PHP was used to generate a contact form. The relevant files are in `\bin\contact-me.php`.

The published version of the website can be found at: http://foothillhighschoolseniors.com.

The current version of Boostrap (v4.0.0 at the time of writing this) can be found here: http://getbootstrap.com/.
