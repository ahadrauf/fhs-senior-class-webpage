# fhs-senior-class-webpage
This project contains the project files for Foothill High School's 2015-16 senior class webpage. I used HTML and CSS to form the basic structure of the webpage, JavaScript to automate website updates and display upcoming events on the homepage, and PHP to generate a contact form.

The published version of the website can be found at: http://foothillhighschoolseniors.com.
